# Colpitts Oscillator and Amplitude Modulation

This project focuses on the design, simulation, and construction of a Colpitts Oscillator, followed by its application in amplitude modulation and demodulation.

## Part 1: Colpitts Oscillator

### Objective
To design, simulate, and construct a Colpitts Oscillator capable of generating stable and tunable sinusoidal oscillations within a specified frequency range.

### Key Components
- Non-ideal amplifier (transistor-based)
- LC oscillation circuit
- Common Emitter Transistor configuration


### Design Considerations
1. **Frequency of Oscillation:** ω = √((C₁ + C₂) / (C₁C₂L₃))
2. **Gain of the Oscillator:** A₁ = -C₁/C₂

### Implementation
- Designed circuit using \(C_1 = C_2 = 1 \text{ nF}\) and \(L_3 = 5 \text{ μH}\)
- **Expected frequency:** 3.2847 MHz
- **Simulated frequency:** 3.7 MHz
- **Hardware (DSO) frequency:** 3.83 MHz

### Challenges
1. Circuit sensitivity to capacitor values
2. Initial oversight of Radio Frequency Choke (RFC)

## Part 2: Application - Amplitude Modulation

### Switching Modulation
Implemented a switching modulator circuit for amplitude modulation.

### Demodulation
Used a low-pass filter to demodulate the amplitude modulated signal.

### Results
